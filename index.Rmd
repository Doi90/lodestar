# What is *lodestar*?

A lodestar is a star used as a guide for navigation by ship (like Polaris, the North Star), but I was just after a short, snappy name for the GitHub repository that somehow related to the guides/tutorials I put together over time. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

The collection of guides and tutorials found in *lodestar* are things I've put together for various workshops/meetups or guides that I felt were lacking elsewhere. New guides will get added sporadically.

*lodestar* is now living as a GitHub page via *bookdown* now that RawGit has been shut down.
